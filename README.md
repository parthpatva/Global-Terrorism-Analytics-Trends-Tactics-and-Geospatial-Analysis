# Global-Terrorism-Analytics-Trends-Tactics-and-Geospatial-Analysis
This project analyzes the Global Terrorism Database (1970–2017), mapping the 2010 surge and 2014 peak. Using CesiumJS and Pydeck, it replaces 2D heatmaps with realistic 3D globe visualizations to identify tactical shifts and regional outliers like the MENA region and South Asia.
